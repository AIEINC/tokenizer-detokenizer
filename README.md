# Tokenizer-Detokenizer: AI-Driven Multi-Language Auto-Code Generator

## Overview

This project is an AI-assisted code generation engine that tokenizes and detokenizes multiple programming languages using a spreadsheet-driven approach. By defining token references for code components in a spreadsheet, you can generate fully functional source code in different languages — including Python, JavaScript, Go, C++, Rust, PHP, and Swift — directly from structured inputs.

## Key Features

- **Multi-language support**: Tokenization for Python, JavaScript, Go, C++, Rust, PHP, Swift.
- **Spreadsheet-based code generation**: Use Excel or CSV to define your program components.
- **AI-ready token mappings**: Clean token-to-code abstraction for functional transformation.
- **Command-line operation**: Fully functional in Termux and Linux environments.
- **Automatic GitHub deployment**: Easily push updates to your repository using one script.
- **Testing framework**: Auto-validation of token mappings and output accuracy.

## How It Works

1. **Tokenization**: Source code is scanned and reduced to short tokens (e.g. `F001`, `IO001`).
2. **Spreadsheet Mapping**: Tokens are assigned to components in a spreadsheet.
3. **Code Generation**: The system reads the spreadsheet and outputs full source code.
4. **De-tokenization**: Reverses tokens back into working code for each language.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Tokenize Source Code
```bash
python tokenizer.py
# Select "tokenize"
# Choose your language
# Enter source file path

2. De-tokenize JSON File

python tokenizer.py
# Select "detokenize"
# Choose language
# Enter path to tokenized JSON

3. Generate Code from Spreadsheet

python tokenizer.py
# Select "spreadsheet"
# Provide path to CSV or Excel file


---

Deployment Instructions

1. Run Full Setup, Test & Push

chmod +x all_in_one.sh
./all_in_one.sh

2. Push Updates to GitHub

chmod +x update.sh
./update.sh

3. Manual File Setup (if needed)

chmod +x create_required_files.sh
./create_required_files.sh


---

Spreadsheet Format


---

Testing

Run the test suite:

python test_tokenizer.py

Verifies tokenized output matches expected mappings

Supports Python, JavaScript, Go (expandable)



---

Contribution & Roadmap

[ ] Add support for Kotlin, TypeScript, Shell, and Java

[ ] Integrate GPT-based prompt-to-token conversion

[ ] Add web UI for spreadsheet uploads

[ ] Cloud sync with rclone + GDrive/Dropbox
